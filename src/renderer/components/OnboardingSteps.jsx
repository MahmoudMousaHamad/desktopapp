	// 	description: `The idea behind JobApplier is new and was never done before, as far as we know.
	// 		We realized that applying to jobs involves a lot of the same repetitive tasks: filling out
	// 		the same information, clicking the same buttons, searching, and attaching the same stuff.
	// 		You get the idea. We also know that the more job applications you send out, the better your chances
	// 		are at getting a job.
	// 		Well, computers are great at automating boring tasks, such as applying to jobs. And
	// 		if we can automate applying to jobs, it means that we can apply to more and more jobs with little
	// 		to no effort. Sounds too good to be true. But it is true. That is why we created JobApplier!
	// 		We created a "bot", which is just a computer program that applies for jobs on your behalf.
	// 		It does all the boring tasks for you and it even learns about you and answers job application questions
	// 		on your behalf. Cool, right? Okay, so, how does it work?
	// 		It's quite simple actually. All you need is a computer, a phone and an internet connection.

	// 		The bot will try to answer questions on your behalf, but if it isn't sure about a certain question,
	// 		it will ask you to answer the question. The bot will send this question to your mobile where you can
	// 		answer it there and the bot will get your answer and it will answer the question on the job application.
	// 		You can also answer the question in the Desktop application if you want.
